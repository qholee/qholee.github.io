	<p>If everything was forever then it wouldn’t be as beautiful.<br>
	It’s like when you’re young and someone hands you a lollipop.<br> 
	You have it for a brief moment and it’s gone.<br> 
	It makes it so much sweeter I think.<br>
<br>
	My subjects are brief moments, impermanent and imperfect.<br>
	Through my practice I hope to create spaces they can call home.<br>
<br>
<br>
	Kyu Ho Lee is a South Korean Artist currently based in New York, NY.<br>
	Although rooted in drawing, his practice spans from oil paintings to paper folding, mark collecting and other time based work. <br>
